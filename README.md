# Personal Portfolio (Tailwind + AOS)

Simple responsive portfolio template built with plain HTML, Tailwind via CDN, and AOS for scroll animations.

Files:
- `index.html` — main site
- `styles.css` — small custom styles
- `script.js` — interactivity (mobile menu, form demo, AOS init)

How to use:
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Replace placeholder text, images and links with your personal content.
3. For a production build, integrate Tailwind locally and remove CDN if desired.

Notes:
- Contact form is a demo: connect to your preferred backend or service (Formspree, Netlify Forms, etc.)
- Images use Unsplash public URLs as placeholders.
